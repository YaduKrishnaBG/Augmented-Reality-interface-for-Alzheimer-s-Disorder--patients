# AR-interface-for-AD-patients

The augmented reality interface was created using Unity engine,
It can be used as a smartphone application and also used with a wearable augmented reality
headset like Microsoft HoloLens.
OpenCV integrated with Unity and with a face recognition algorithm and custom-made
database with the photographs and details of the people that are interacting with the patient,
the face recognition part of the interface can be done. This will help the patient to identify any
person entering in the room real-time by receiving the details such as name relation with the
patient and even a photograph connecting memory with them.
Similarly, with the help of object detection SDK or algorithms the same tech can be used to detect
the objects from the environment and then receive the details from a database. This will help the
patient to identify the objects around the room and how to use details in case if they forget it
without external help. Alternatively, marker tracking can also be used to get similar results with
less effort and more efficiency. In this case, common objects should be marked with and should
be tracked with the AR camera.
Finally, a virtual asset can be made with animated 3-D assets and make it interactive using scripts.
Also, voice commands can be given to the interface to make it more interactive. This can act as a
companion, trainer, virtual assistant, etc. helping the patient to be engaged, learn new things, do
activities, and get instructions for daily tasks.
